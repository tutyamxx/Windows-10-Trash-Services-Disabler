# Windows 10 Trash Services Disabler

* Batch script to disable all trash Windows 10 services that run for no reason, clogging the resources.
* I made this to reduce my time disabling them individually.
* I run this every time I do a fresh OS install, so use it at your own risk.

# How to run

* Download the `disable_trash_services.bat` 
* Right click -> `Run as Administrator`
* Wait for magic to be done
